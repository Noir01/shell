# Shell

An extremely simplistic and featureless shell written in Rust.

## Features

- [ ] Execute commands
- [ ] Change directory
- [x] Exit shell
- [ ] Pipe commands
- [ ] Redirect input/output
- [ ] Background processes
- [ ] Tab completion
- [ ] History
- [ ] Custom prompt

## Why?

I wanted to learn how to build one. This is purely for educational purposes. I do not plan on using this as my daily driver nor do I plan on making it feature-rich. It exists only for me to play around with and learn from.

## Usage

```cargo run --release```
